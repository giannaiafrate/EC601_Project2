Useful links I found: https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/tutorials/analyze-past-conversations https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/tutorials/step-by-step-guide-to-making-your-first-request-to-the-twitter-api-v2 https://towardsdatascience.com/an-extensive-guide-to-collecting-tweets-from-twitter-api-v2-for-academic-research-using-python-3-518fcb71df2a https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/tweets/search/api-reference/get-tweets-search-all https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/early-access

Useful Google links to getting started on the application: https://cloud.google.com/natural-language/automl/docs/quickstart?authuser=1
