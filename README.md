# EC601_Project2
Project 2 is on analyzing twitter feeds

The first phase is testing out the twitter API and understanding how to pull various data.

The Twitter step-by-step walks through how to do this in json on the command line. However, I will be performing this project on python by running it on Spyder launched through Anaconda. Therefore, the first step of this project will be figuring out how to properly set the token and pull various links on Twitter.
