#RepeatLA #RaysUp #ResilientSF"
"Game 2 was pretty abysmal, Rays fans.But it is no bigger than game one in the sense that it's just one game.This team is resilient as all get out remember?Remember August 11, that 20-8 loss to the Red Sox? The next night,they bounced back for an 8-1 win to win the series #RaysUp"
"The Rays are fine. Time for some group therapy. The ALDS is now tied at 1-1, a great performance in GM1, and an explosion by BOS in GM2. Randy stole home! Luplow hit a Grand Slam! Playoff baseball is awesome &amp; frustrating. Let‚Äôs talk! #relentless #raysup https://t.co/Kc1CD5sRYo"

"GETTING EVEN. En el #TropicanaField , hubo un ataque despiadado de 20 imparables, incl. 5 HRs (Bogaerts, Verdugo, Devers , Hern√°ndez, Mart√≠nez), y  #DirtyWater venci√≥, sin problemas, a #RaysUp 14-6, en Juego 2 de #ALDS (Serie #BOSvsTB empatada 1-1). #HazloGrande #Postseason"
