Mariners will lead D3 alone after closing this out."
"Narragansett busts a third down run for a score and recovers an ensuing onside kick. Mariners could salt this one away with another score. They hold a 42-26 lead on Pilgrim, 7:42 left."
"Also, we might consider tax incentives of some sort for essential workers for the next two years or something like that. Dockyard workers, mariners, nurses, delivery drivers, truckers, daycare workers, etc. We need them to be on the job. Better than a billboard, give 'em $$$"
