Who wants to bet on the San Fran and dodgers series? And who wants to bet on the fury-wilder fight? I got giants and fury
"Get in on today's #MLBPostseason action with a #Dodgers vs. #Giants #MLB Pick from Oracle Park in San Fran! ⚾️💰

"TODD BALL: San Fran Giants v. L.A. Dodgers, just what MLB fans ordered https://t.co/XHg3Les5hb"
"You're god damn right I'm riding with the Giants +103 vs LA. San Fran is an insane 12-0 in Logan Webb home starts this season + he was strong vs LAD this season, allowing 4 ERs in 3 starts. Buehler is coming off his worst month of the season. Hitting and bullpen is a wash."
#Dodgers &amp; Giants open National League Division Series tonight @ Oracle Park in San Fran. It’s a matchup of #MLB’s best 2 records/1st time 2 have met in playoffs. Giants won NL West by just 1 game. LA seeks to settle the score. Walker Buehler has the start for LA @ 6:30PM PST/TBS https://t.co/446KS3hIM8
Good reason to root for San Fran. I love when books have to worry about a good team winning. In the article 1 book was still giving 10-1 odds in July. 100-1 to start the year. This is why you always put a prop bet on your favorite team to start the season https://t.co/fVMbVSHixZ
Might fuck around and take trip up to San Fran Saturday and watch the giants vs dodgers game 🤔😬
"Didnt she live in Brentwood and San Fran?  

And NO ONE likes the Giants. https://t.co/N7mRyt6D1Z"
"Pumped to be heading to San Fran to cover this National League Divisional Series. 
 
One of the great rivalries in sport, and finally a playoff clash between the Dodgers and Giants. 
 
Coverage begins tomorrow on @Sportsnet https://t.co/M540QIeebt"
San Fran Giants are winning the World Series
Throwback to the last time I was at Dodgers stadium in honor of the @Dodgers punching the ticket to go take over San Fran..... Hey Giants... Here comes the #Champs https://t.co/w1UyWXAkti
"San Fran Giants.. NY giants.. little giants, don't matter. #Dodgers in 3."
My team is out of the playoffs so I root for San Fran Giants here. Let's go @itsTKbabyy
Let’s fucking go! Can’t wait to beat that San Fran Giants ass! #Dodgers #NLWildCard #NLDS
"#Dodgers win, the Eviler Empire (Yankees are the original Evil Empire) wins! Their  True  Home is still Brooklyn, so I count them and San Fran Giants as kinda NY team wins. Cuz we know Yinkees or Metsies ain‘t won since 2009 and 1986😤😤"
See u in San Fran Giants!! Let’s fucken go baby!! 💪🏽💯💯
"The Giants won 107 games. The Dodgers won 106 games. San Fran won the season series, 10-9. Los Angeles outscored them 80-78. Can’t get more even. 

Can’t wait."
I’m so glad I’m a Giants fan. Let’s go San Fran!
"CHRIS TAYLOR WALKS IT OFF FOR LA!!!

The Dodgers will head to San Fran and face the giants in the NLDS #Dodgers"
"Let’s fucking go! See you in San Fran, giants https://t.co/mfwQbCpeKK"
Dave Roberts said he owes Bruce Bochy dinner and a bottle of 🍷 Bordeaux of his choice and that the #giants manager will probably choose an expensive one. Bet on who wins the NL West was made in August. If the #dodgers win he can hand deliver in San Fran for the NLDS https://t.co/GfWAJWd0cW
Let’s go Giants. San Fran forever!!
"Like, I know the Giants played way better than expectations but they still won that division in a 162 game season. Are we saying the Dodgers are better than that and San Fran is a fluke? There's a reason they're in the Wild Card game and not in the NLDS right now."
"So, if it's not the Brewers, what's your World Series matchup/pick? I'm taking the Giants over the Rays in 7. LaMonte Wade Jr. with a clutch go ahead triple in triples alley in San Fran in the bottom of the 8th of game 7."
I know Dodgers are good and San Fran.. but I think I’m going with the brewers this year I don’t think white Sox’s or Huston or rays can handle their pitching. And I think they can handle the giants or Dodgers

"Fact is San Fran had their best record ever, hard to argue with that. The insane thing is either LA or STL is going home after a single game despite a great season by both and a massive win streak and still hot run by STL. And winner gets Giants. If it’s LA vs SF. Winner wins NL. https://t.co/Socp6PIwDs"
San Fran vs Tampa; Giants in 6 https://t.co/2L7yRB6T8T
No one told me my San Fran Giants were good this year
"Prediction time!!

NYY vs BOS.  
Yankees win and go to Tampa

STL VS LAD  
Dodgers win and go to San Fran

ALDS
NYY vs TB
Yankees win series 3-1

HOU vs CWS
Astros win series 3-1

SFG vs LAD
Giants win series 3-2

ATL vs MIL
Brewers win 3-2"
Y’all think the San Fran giants magic runs out next season and they come back down to earth or do you think this season they had is the start of a really good run they will have for future years.
How did the san fran giants win ONE HUNDRED AND SEVEN GAMES
"I went to San Fran, LA and NYC last summer but I’m curious how their baseball teams did before October baseball?
Giants: best team in baseball
Dodgers: Second best team in baseball
Yankees: made the wild card
Mets: suffered after I visited citi field"
Nice to see the San Fran Giants win the NL West.  Well-deserved!  Buster Posey is a winner.  And should be a Hall of Famer.
THE SAN FRAN-FUCKING-CISCO GIANTS!!!!!
SAN FRAN GIANTS WHAT A YEAR
"We are in a short rain delay at Busch. Cards lead the Cubs 2–1 in the 4th. This game doesn’t really mean anything, but the Giants game does. San Fran leads San Diego 7-1 in the 4th. If Giants win, Cards will go to LA for wildcard game with Dodgers on Wednesday. https://t.co/0CTJlMp3Rf"
The Giants want the Division and deliver a massive at-bat. 5-1 San Fran
Julio Urias became #Dodgers' 1st 20-game winner since Kershaw in 2014 (Kersh placed on IL Sat). If LA (105-56) beats Milwaukee again Sun &amp; rival 1st-place Giants (106-55) lose to San Diego again-they tie for title! That would force an NL West decider Game 163 in San Fran Mon #MLB https://t.co/qsctcyIcHb

"Listen up people, I'm only going to explain this once.  Go and bet your mortgage San Fran wins the Series against Dodgers.  Not sure if it will go 4 or 5 games but Giants won't lose. I usually don't give bets but I'm in a jovial mood tonight. DM me if you want to give me proceeds"
