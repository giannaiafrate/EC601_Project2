"Yesterday, I was told to wear shorts &amp; tennis shoes.. so my immediate thought was my fatass was about to be tortured in the Houston heat… but instead I was surprised with an #Astros game. ☺️

Astros won &amp; I was fed well. 👌🏻"
Y'all gonna make me say it...Yankees fans are just as obnoxious as Cowboys and astros fans https://t.co/tbBb5OOMAp
It’s sad cause the Astros the only good team in ya city lmfao https://t.co/wYsHGO2ji9

Ya but not agianst a team as good as the Astros. Not to mention the playoffs and regular season are levels different. The whitesox inexperience in the playoffs is really showing with how they are handling their loses. https://t.co/lXwQapsIBo
"I'm glad the Sox don't play again until Sunday. I may get mad at the Sox but JFC some of the ""fans"" are just insufferable. I'm mad. I'm frustrated. I want them to win every game. I hate the Astros but they are a really good team and poor decisions were made today."

The Astros need to be stopped
"Legit wondering where this White Sox love is from? They were in the worst division in MLB - 93 wins getting fat and happy off losers. 

Astros? Best division in MLB. Still won it. Still gon beat your sorry team’s ass."

"Yo no coincido mucho con esa frase que dice ""los astros inclinan, mas no determinan""... 
Los astros predeterminan, y uno puede en todo caso elegir qué hacer con eso o vivirlo de la mejor manera.
No es astroexcusa, es simplemente reconocer que estamos hechos de estrellas."
