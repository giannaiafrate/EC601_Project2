"The #WhiteSox are getting a super hot Luis Robert right now. He‚Äôs seeing everything well and if he elevates, he has a chance to #ChangeTheGame with one swing in Game 3. And Game 4. Yes, Game 4 will be played."
"Not much we can do now but let the boys feed off the energy we‚Äôre about to bring to the park on Sunday‚Ä¶.. I haven‚Äôt lost hope yet, this team fucks‚Ä¶ SOX IN 5 BABY #ChangeTheGame"

Wasted 4th overall pick for what?!?!  #changethegame
The Chicago #WhiteSox are the #Rockies of ‚Äúgood‚Äù teams. #MLB #ChangeTheGame
"As I listen to @C1McKnight do the postgame, I cannot believe Michael Kopech has not pitched in this series. 

That is unacceptable. Kopech has to be a factor in this series. 

#ChangeTheGame"
"He works for the #houstonchronicle  he did a interview with @TheRealSoxChic #SOXCHIC about fandomship so I may be in the #Houston paper. He loved my energy!

"Ozzie is pissed on the post game show. He's 100% fucking right, nothing against Rod√≥n but Cease, this shouldn't even be fucking hard Rod√≥n isn't 100%. Please get Ozzie back as manager if we lose this series. #ChangeTheGame #Postseason"

Unless Tony quits. He‚Äôll still be the manager in ‚Äò22. #ChangeTheGame is not gonna have 3 different managers. In 3 consecutive seasons. js ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Need a better roster. To compete for a Championship.!

We‚Äôre not done #changethegame
I'm not happy but not worried.  Series is going 5.  If the @whitesox don't play this during Houston's bp I'd be highly disappointed.  #ChangeTheGame  https://t.co/1UvP9bkEld
"Idk, maybe it‚Äôs just my ‚ÄúNever say die‚Äù mentality.. I‚Äôm not giving up just yet #changethegame"
Winning two in a row at home is incredibly doable. Let‚Äôs tie the series and head back to Houston with momentum and heads up. We gotta support the hell out of the Sox on Sunday and Monday. #changethegame
"Disappointed but not stressing out

Top of the order responding to the bright lights really well.

But need a lot more from Eloy, Yo, and Yas if we're gonna push this thing to 5

Looking forward to seeing what the guys are made of

It's time

"Good luck finding certain White Sox jerseys. The supply chain issues affecting everything from toilet paper to chicken wings are hitting team apparel, too. https://t.co/9UQ50WxtE0"
The gap between White Sox and Royals is not much. Can‚Äôt wait until next season.
"Did Our Sox bullpen fail miserably in the Game 2 loss to the Astros? Absolutely! But whether Tony La Russa mismanaged his relievers, given the three-hitter rule, is highly debatable. His guys let him down, and Craig Kimbrel supposedly is an elite closer. https://t.co/q3nAbT5TPZ"

"Here‚Äôs a fun fact, the Cubs and White Sox both have 2 wins in the month of October"

"Astros shifted 46.2% of all plate appearances this season.

White Sox shifted 20.3%.

It‚Äôs not ‚Äúwe‚Äôre hitting it where they are and they‚Äôre not hitting it where we are‚Äù. The White Sox are choosing not to be where they‚Äôre hitting it."
"The people have spoken. The final four teams according to my polls will be Giants, Braves, White Sox, Red Sox. Not looking too good for a couple of these teams. https://t.co/9vm65aZdZV"
"Just curious of everyone's opinions, not necessarily a right or wrong answer to this one. In 3 years who do you think is in better shape, Cubs or White Sox?"
"As an Astros fan, whoever poured the drink on that white Sox fan, I hope he got a beating for that. Dgaf what team you represent that just dumb af https://t.co/SeuISPOolr"
"Kudos to all fans of both teams for not starting any fights like the one in the viral tweet from the Astros-White Sox game.

Also, this encouraging quote from my #RedSox fan friend: ‚Äú#Rays fans are (bleeping) loud!‚Äù Way to shatter the stereotype that we don‚Äôt care enough. #RaysUp"

"Excellent story and #WhiteSox context from one of the most underrated sports writers in Chicago, @StacyStClair.

Prove them wrong, Tony La Russa, and White Sox fans will take it all back https://t.co/ML4mPTIAbF"

"Watching back Game 2 as hard as it is you can see this White Sox team can win we‚Äôve just been poorly managed &amp; the pitching giving up 9 walks 6 of them scoring doesn‚Äôt help in series. There‚Äôs been close moments regardless of scoreboard Sox just need to execute, it isn‚Äôt over"
My favorite team went 52-110 and part of me still feels bad for White Sox fans https://t.co/GNYhgat1Vz
"The White Sox pitching staff had the highest strikeout rate in baseball this season, powering through their defensive shortcomings. 

The best contact lineup in baseball is proving to be quite the foil, and providing a view of how the Sox must improve

https://t.co/cqvQSwhM43"
I am getting hyped for tomorrow. Fuck the White Sox for doing this shit to me over and over.
"the White Sox are 49-37 without games against teams in the AL Central, they are absolutely coasted on an easy division and it's sad more people can't see that"
"The White Sox traded for Kimbrel, hands down the most lockdown closer in baseball at that point (and is a NOTORIOUSLY REGIMENTED closer); then let Tony La Russa make him a setup man behind Liam Hendricks.

Hey Aroldis Chapman, you're going to set the table for Hector Rondon."
