"A fitting last game to a so close so much farther @Athletics season. Open with hitting Canha, tie with a KD homerun, close compliments of Houston. May the #RiseAndGrind tag be retired and the Matts magically stay put. https://t.co/2fBYumggmE"
Well the @Athletics season has been over for an hour and I already can‚Äôt wait till next year #riseandgrind #RootedInOakland #RideTheWave
